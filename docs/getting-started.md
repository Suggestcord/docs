## **Step 1: Add Suggestcord to your server**
You can add Suggestcord to your server through [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=740929714192908289&scope=bot&permissions=268823632). The bot requires all the listed permission otherwise it won't function properly. The bot can be invited to any server where you have the **Manage Server** permission.

## **Step 2: Configure Suggestcord**
In order for Suggestcord to work, you must set it up. You can do this by running the [setup](administration/setup.md) command (make sure your DMs aren't locked otherwise the bot can't send you the setup prompt).

## **Step 3: Start posting suggestions**
After you have finished the setup prompt, you may start using the [suggest](suggestions/suggest.md) command.

?> If you are encountering issues while configuring the bot, you can ask for assistance in our [support server](https://discord.gg/6MnZzkh)
